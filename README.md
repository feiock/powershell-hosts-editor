powershell-hosts-editor
=======================

quick n dirty powershell script that removes/adds lines from hosts. 

**DON'T** have any extra empty newlines in your editor (one is okay), or you'll see your whole hosts file get gobbled up in seconds. Also, back up your hosts file (if you have anything in it besides the default text).


Possible additions: automate the task without the need for task scheduler
